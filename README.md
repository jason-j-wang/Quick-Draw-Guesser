# Quick Draw Guesser

### This project uses the Keras API from Tensorflow to build a CNN model to classify 100 randomly chosen sub-classes from the [Quick, Draw! dataset](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset). 

### The current version 1 model is able to classify pictures with 81% accuracy and will be improved in later updates.
